# Stacks

Stacks is a weekly workout tracker built for athletes who value consistency. The app pulls in real training data from the Strava API and displays it in a clean feed - one week at a time. Each workout card shows key stats (duration, calories, average heart rate). Tap into any workout for detailed metrics, a heart rate graph using SwiftUI, notes, and tags. Stacks helps you see your training “brick by brick,” with each week forming a new stack of progress.
